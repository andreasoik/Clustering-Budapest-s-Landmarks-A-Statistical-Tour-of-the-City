# Clustering-Budapest-s-Landmarks-A-Statistical-Tour-of-the-City
In this project, I identified the most popular landmarks in Budapest and implemented various clustering algorithms in both R and Python, including K-Means, DBSCAN, Partition Around Medoids, Gaussian Mixture Models, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models, and Mean-Shift, based on their coordinates.
